# Smart-Garden-with-Raspberry-pi
#### Embedded systems IoT Project In summary, the Smart Garden application aims to measure the active temperature and moisture  value of your garden and send an email to the consumer.

When the moisture of the soil in the garden falls below the ideal moisture value, an email is sent to the consumer asking you to water the soil.

If the temperature of the soil takes a value different from the ideal temperature range,an email will be sent to the consumer asking you to warm or cool the soil.
